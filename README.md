# subdued.social
I would love it if someone set up a [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) instance at subdued.social for the Bellingham, Washington area (also known as the City of Subdued Excitement).

Or, should it be [salishsea.social](https://salishsea.social) instead?

I don't have the capacity to set up and run the server myself, but I can help!
