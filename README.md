# subdued.social
~I would love it if someone set up a [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) instance at subdued.social for the Bellingham, Washington area (also known as the City of Subdued Excitement).~

**UPDATE**: we are now live at [subdued.social](https://subdued.social/about)! Come join us there!

Also, I am squatting on [salishsea.social](https://salishsea.social) if anybody wants it. I will probably let the registration lapse in a year if nobody volunteers to pick it up. Personally I think I will be happy at [subdued.social](https://subdued.social/about).
